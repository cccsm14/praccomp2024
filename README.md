### Final Project Info 

#### For my final project, the goal was to create or adapt a machine learning model to recognize microscope images I use in my research. You can view all relevant information to the project in the folder labeled "_*Final Project*_". 
Originally found on TensorFlow's website (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) for binary image classification, a concatonation of the borrowed code is located in this folder. The file is titled "_FlowerRecognitionCodeBorrowed_" I adapted a version of this code for my data set, and it is titled "_InflorescenceRecogCode_." The images I used for training and testing my model are available within their own sub folders. Iterations of my work as I brainstormed ideas can be found in "_FirstattemptImgClassificationCode_" and "_Practice.Alternative_."
